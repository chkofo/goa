<p>Kutaisi is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities 
in the world and the third-most populous city in Georgia after 
Tbilisi and Batumi. Situated 221 kilometres (137 miles)
west of Tbilisi, on the Rioni River, it is the capital of the western region of Imereti 
Historically one of the major cities of Georgia, it served as political 
center of Colchis in the Middle Ages as 
capital of the Kingdom of Abkhazia[7] and Kingdom of Georgia 
and later as the capital of the Kingdom of Imereti. 
From October 2012 to December 2018, Kutaisi was the seat of the Parliament 
of Georgia as an effort to decentralise the Georgian government.</p>

<h2>history</h2>

<img src="image copy.png" width="1000">

<P>Archaeological evidence indicates that the city functioned as the capital of the Colchis in the sixth to fifth 
centuries BC.[8] It is believed that, in Argonautica, a Greek epic poem about Jason and the Argonauts and their journey to Colchis, 
author Apollonius Rhodius considered Kutaisi their final destination as well as the residence of King Aeëtes. Later, it was the capital of the kingdom of Lazica until being occupied briefly by the Arabs. An Arab incursion into western Georgia was repelled by Abkhazians jointly with Lazic and Iberian allies in 736, towards c.786, Leon II won his full independence from Byzantine and transferred his capital to Kutaisi, thus unifying 
Lazica and Abasgia via a dynastic union. The latter led the unification of the Georgian monarchy in the 11th century.
From 1008 to 1122, Kutaisi served as the capital of the United Kingdom of Georgia, and, from the 15th 
century until 1810, it was the capital of the Imeretian Kingdom. In 1508, the city was conquered by Selim I, 
who was the son of Bayezid II, the sultan of the Ottoman Empire.
During the 17th century, Imeretian kings made many appeals to Russian Empire to help them in their struggle 
for independence from the Ottomans. All these appeals were ignored as Russia did not want to spoil relations with Turkey.
 Only in the reign of Catherine the Great, in 1768, were troops of general Gottlieb Heinrich Totleben sent to join the forces of 
 King Heraclius II of Georgia, who hoped to reconquer the Ottoman-held southern Georgian lands, with Russian help. 
 Totleben helped King Solomon I of Imereti to recover his capital, Kutaisi, on August 6, 1770. Finally, the Russian-Turkish 
 wars ended in 1810 with the annexation of the Imeretian Kingdom by the Russian Empire. The city was the administrative 
 capital of the Kutais Uyezd and the larger Kutaisi Governorate, which included much of west Georgia.
 In March 1879, the city was the site of a blood libel trial that attracted attention all over the Russian Empire.
  Nine Georgian Jews from Sachkhere were falsely accused of killing a Christian girl and using her blood for allegedly 
Jewish religious purposes.[9] The trial took place at the Kutaisi Circuit Court, which had been established in 1868 as one of 
  several new courts in the Caucasus created by Tsar Alexander II.'s Judicial Reform. After a ten-day trial, with nearly 70 witnesses, 
  the nine defendants were acquitted as the defence lawyers Petr Aleksandrov and Lev Kupernik convinced the judges that the accusations 
  against the Jewish men were mostly based on false testimony.[9]
 Kutaisi was a major industrial center before Georgia's independence on 9 April 1991. 
 Independence was followed by the economic collapse of the country, and, as a result, many inhabitants of 
 Kutaisi have had to work abroad. Small-scale trade prevails among the rest of the population.
 In 2011, Mikheil Saakashvili, the president of Georgia, signed a constitutional amendment 
 relocating the parliament to Kutaisi.[10] On 26 May 2012, Saakashvili inaugurated the new Parliament 
 building in Kutaisi. This was done in an effort to decentralise power and shift some political control 
 closer to Abkhazia, although it has been criticised as marginalising the legislature, and also for the demolition 
 of a Soviet War Memorial formerly at the new building's location.[11] The subsequent government of the Georgian Dream 
 passed a new constitution that moved the parliament back to Tbilisi, effective from January 2019.[12]</P>
