# 1. Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the even numbers.
# numbers = [1,2,3,4]
# def sum_even(even) :
#     sum = 0
#     for i in even :
#         if i % 2 == 0 :
#             sum += i
#     print(sum)

# sum_even(numbers) 


    




# 2. Create a function that accepts a string and returns the string reversed without using any built-in reverse functions.

# name = "giorgi"
# def reverse_name(x) :
#     print(x[::-1])

# reverse_name(name)



# 3. Implement a function that takes a number and returns the factorial of that number using recursion.
# def fact(x) :
#     if x == 1 :
#         return 1
#     return fact(x-1)* x

# print(fact(5))
    

# 4. Design a function that accepts two lists and returns a list of common elements without using set operations.

# numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
# numbers1 = [1,8,9,11,2,3,56,4,5]

# def common_elements(x,y) :

#     numbers2 = []
#     for i in x :
#         for o in y :
#             if i == o :
#                 numbers2.append(i)
#     print(numbers2) 

# common_elements(numbers,numbers1)


# 5. Write a function that takes a string and returns the number of vowels in the string.

# name = "pineapple"
# vowels = ["a","e","i","o","u"]
# def vow(name,vowels) :

#     count = 0
#     for i in name :
#         for o in vowels :
#             if i == o :
#                 count += 1
#     print(count)

# vow(name,vowels)

# 6. Create a function that accepts a list of integers and returns the list sorted in ascending order without using built-in sort functions.
numbers1= [1,11,2,33,45,61,22,2,3]
sorted_num = []
def sorted(numbers) :
    for i in sorted_num :







# 7. Implement a function that takes two strings and returns True if one string is a permutation of the other.




# 8. Create a function that takes a number and returns True if it is a prime number.




# 9. Design a function that accepts a list of strings and returns a list with the strings sorted by their lengths.
